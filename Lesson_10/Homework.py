1. Reveal_Message - in place. (replace and not pop append)
2. Queue out of stack - improvements:
	* No need to shift back from one stack to another + no prints.
	* 
3. Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:

s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode"
return 2.
 

Note: You may assume the string contains only lowercase English letter
